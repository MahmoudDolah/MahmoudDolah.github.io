About a month ago, my manager put in his notice at Insider and moved onto another opportunity. It was upsetting to see him go, but I'm happy to see him move onto a new opportunity.    
That being said, it has put the SRE team (and myself) into an interesting position - we have to interview a replacement! I've never been in a position where I've had to interview my boss before, so it was certainly interesting to prep for, and here's how we did it.


## Interview Questions
As far as the loop itself was concerned, I was paired with another member of the SRE team to perform the Technical portion of the interview. After discussing as a group more about what we wanted the role to consist of, we agreed that our new manager, while not actively being an individual contributor, should definitely still have a good degree of technical skill (at least enough to properly scope projects, perform some form of code review, etc)
