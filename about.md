I'm Mahmoud Dolah, and I'm a Software Developer at Something Digital since June 2017.
Before that, I worked at Brickwork Software and BNY Mellon.

You can find me on [Github][my-github] and checkout some of the [cool stuff][my-projects] I've worked on, like this research paper about finding [firmware entry points in memory][project-firmware] and [WeatherBet][weatherbet]
