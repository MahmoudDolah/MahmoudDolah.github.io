I'm Mahmoud Dolah, and I'm working as an SRE at Insider Inc.

You can find me on [Github][my-github] and checkout some of the [cool stuff][my-projects] I've worked on, like this research paper about finding [firmware entry points in memory][project-firmware] and [WeatherBet][weatherbet].
The best way to get in touch with me is on [Twitter][my-twitter].
